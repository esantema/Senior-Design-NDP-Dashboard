# Senior Design NDP Dashboard 
This report was part of my senior design project for Next Door Photos. I took charge of creating a Power BI dashboard that members of the NDP executive team could use to analyze key company data. This included pages to analyze data for sales, service goals, service tickets, quality assurance, and product adoption packages. The entire project required constant communication with key stakeholders from the entire NDP team. I am open to any feedback! 

**NOTE:** This uploaded version of the report uses a mock Excel file as the source, not real NDP data.
